RedBot Obstacle Course Traversal with Claw Mechanism

This project involves programming a RedBot to autonomously navigate an obstacle course using hardcoded instructions. 
The RedBot is equipped with a motor that acts as a claw mechanism to interact with objects along the course.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: The RedBot follows a predefined path to traverse an obstacle course.
Claw Mechanism: A motor-controlled claw allows the RedBot to pick up or interact with objects.
Hardcoded Logic: The robot's movements and claw actions are pre-programmed for specific tasks.

Hardware Requirements:
RedBot chassis
RedBot motors and wheels
Motor for claw mechanism
Arduino-compatible microcontroller (e.g., RedBot MainBoard)
Power supply (battery pack)
Jumper wires
Optional: Sensors (e.g., line-following, ultrasonic) for enhanced functionality

Installation:
Assemble the RedBot:
Attach the motors and wheels to the RedBot chassis.
Mount the claw mechanism motor to the front or top of the RedBot.
Connect all motors and sensors to the RedBot MainBoard.

Upload the Code:
Install the Arduino IDE from arduino.cc.
Connect the RedBot MainBoard to your computer via USB.
Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided code to the RedBot.

Usage:
Power On:
Turn on the RedBot and place it at the starting point of the obstacle course.

Run the Program:
The RedBot will execute the hardcoded instructions to navigate the course and operate the claw mechanism as needed.
